#   connection against MongoDB. Note that even if the key is stored in the same
#   file as the certificate, both need to be explicitly specified. This option,
#   if present, takes precedence over the values of :ssl_key_string and :ssl_key_object
# @option options [ String ] :ssl_key_string A string containing the PEM-encoded private key
#   used to identify the connection against MongoDB. This parameter, if present,

#   validation.
# @option options [ String ] :ssl_ca_cert The file containing a set of concatenated
#   certification authority certifications used to validate certs passed from the

#   :ssl_ca_cert_object (in order of priority) is required for :ssl_verify.
# @option options [ String ] :ssl_ca_cert_string A string containing a set of concatenated
#   certification authority certifications used to validate certs passed from the
#   other end of the connection. One of :ssl_ca_cert, :ssl_ca_cert_string or
